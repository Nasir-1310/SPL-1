**LearnPhysics:**

A brief description of what this project for:


LearnPhysics is a Physics-based learning project. Its goal is to visualize the fundamental physics formulas and gives solution according to the parameters. The application generally uses these steps : 


**Step 1:** The user will enter the formula's required parameters.
**Step 2:** This application analyzes the data.
**Step 3:**It solves the required problem.
**Step 3:** It shows a visualization of the problem using data.

The following tasks will be performed by this application:

 ```c++
 ➢** Projectile Motion**
      ● Height of projection
      ● Horizontal Distance
      ● Velocity at any time
      ● Time to travel
➢ **Vector analysis**
      ● Boat crossing river vector problem
➢ **Mechanics**
      ● Conservation of momentum
 ```
